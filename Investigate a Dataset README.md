# Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the following Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.


## What do I need to install?
I will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv


## Dataset
I will be investigating the [TMDb movie data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1653145802446080&usg=AOvVaw1wt1jd4_3K2KQf2sAnqPDP), a dataset from Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree. The original data source comes from [Kaggle](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1653145802446782&usg=AOvVaw2F4IDb3U97uYwySqF8FRYN). This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.


## Summary of Findings

The goal of this analysis was to walk through each of the steps in the data analysis process to investigate the TMBd movie dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. After answering some questions based on the dataset, we can make the following conclusion:

+ The genre with the highest release of movies is Drama, followed by Comedy and Thriller.
+ The most filmed cast is Robert De Niro, followed by Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Wills.
+ The director producing most movies is Woody Allen, followed by Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg.
+ The year with the highest number of movies is 2014, followed by 2013 and 2015.
+ The movie with the highest revenue is Avatar and the movie with the lowest revenue is Shattered Glass.
+ The movie with the highest budget is The Warrior's Way and the movie with the lowest budget is Lost & Found.
+ The year with the most popular movie is 2015, followed by 2014, and 2012.
